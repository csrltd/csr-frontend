                        advised management on investing decisions. As a leader, I possess the ability to drive change by

                        implement communications plans, campaigns, and events for a broad range of audiences Including
                        Internal, external, and digital audiences. These campaigns are carried out effectively to
                        promote the organization, Its products, and its services. I have been fortunate enough to work
                        for over 6 years in this field and it's been an enlightening experience. My work with the
                        Marketing and Communications agencies ( Quake Ltd & Brand Speak Global) I worked with has
                        enabled me to work with brands in different sectors including CIMERWA, Unilever Rwanda, Intare
                        Conference Arena, GIZ Rwanda, Gorilla Games, Toyota Rwanda, Babyl Rwanda, Africa Improved Foods,
                        and Jabalee Sports to mention a few. I’m currently working for Comprehensive Staffing Resources,
                        where I’m in charge of Digital Marketing and Communications for the company and I’m ready to
                        share and acquire more skills regarding my field as I help clients to achieve their goals
                        through social media marketing.</p>
