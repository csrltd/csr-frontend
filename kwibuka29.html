                <strong>R</strong>emember the Lives lost, the dreams shattered and the hopes destroyed. We honor their
                memory and vow
                never to forget their story.
                <br>
                <Strong>E</Strong>ngulfed in horror, as husbands turned against wives, neighbor turned against
                neighbor, and the Tutsi
                people hunted like prey in the wild, without any favor, their blood watered our lands.
                <br>
                <strong>M</strong>ysteries we may never understand, why did hatred consume the hearts of those who once
                walked hand in
                hand?
                <br>
                <strong>E</strong>agerly searching for answers to this enigma, of those who were taken in this stigma,
                <br>
                <strong>M</strong>elancholy lingers, a reminder of the cost of hate, of fear, of intolerance, of what
                we lost,
                <br>
                <strong>B</strong>ut through the darkness, we see glimmers of light, in the brave survivors who rose up
                with all their
                might.
                <br>
                <strong>E</strong>ager to heal and find a better way out of the scars that will no longer dictate,
                <br>
                <strong>R</strong>estoring the wounds of the past with love and determination, we build a future that
                last. Where hate
                and fear are vanquished and love and peace reign supreme. <br><br>
