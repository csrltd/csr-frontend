                <p>On International Women's Day we celebrate,
                    The strength and power of women, so great,
                    For generations, they've fought and led,
                    Breaking barriers and pushing ahead.</p>
                <p>From suffragettes who fought for our vote,
                    To scientists who help us to cope,
                    With challenges both big and small,
                    Women have always given their all.</p>
                <p>Mothers, sisters, daughters, and friends,
                    Their love and support never ends,
                    They're there to pick us up when we fall,
                    And help us rise, standing tall.</p>
                <p>So on this day, let's honor and cherish,
                    All the women who have fought and perished,
                    And those who continue to make strides,
                    As we strive for equality and all good resides.</p>
